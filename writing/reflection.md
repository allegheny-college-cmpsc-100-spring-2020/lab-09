# Lab 9 reflection: Solution Repository

## Identify an example of a "setter" method and a "getter" method in `WizardTest.java` (not the `constructor`). Why is each an example?


## In the code block below, paste the `switch` statement you used. Describe how it works.

```java

```


## This lab asked you to use both `switch` and `if` statements. In your own words, what is the difference between these two types of statements?


## The `toString` method of `WizardTest` asked you to implement an `if` statement. Why would code use an `if` statement in that method?


## What was your greatest difficulty with this lab? How did you handle it?


## Having returned from Spring Break, what is one concept used in this lab that you'd like to review?
